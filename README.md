# Car Rental Application
Car Rental Application was built as one of my student assignments at Chas Academy Yrkesh√∂gskola. This application was developed using PHP, MySQL, Twig, JavaScript, HTML and with MVC framework.

It simulates a system for checking in and checking out cars of a car rental company. 

Car Rental Application has all aspects of full stack development process and queries data from a relational database.
